# Functional Programming - Planning a delivery route

This assignment was an exercise in applying ideas form artificial intelligence to the problems of planning an decision-making. The implementation language used was Clojure - a functional programming language we used throughout the year.

The diagram above shows the layout of one floor of an office block. The office has a robot on the floor that is able to navigate around it from room to room, collecting and delivering items. The robot has two modes. It is either:

* Collecting parcels, letters and other items for delivery and taking them to the main office 
* Or, having collected items from the main office, it must deliver them to rooms around the 
floor. 

The assignment was to implement a solution that the robot could use to plan its route around the floor - to demonstrate the efficacy of our solution we needed to complete a range of tasks. These tasks are listed below:
